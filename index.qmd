I'm a graduate student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Master's of Data Science. Before moving to Vancouver, I played professional volleyball for 5 years in Italy, South Korea, and Japan

I graduated from Stanford University in 2018 with a BS in Human Biology and a MS in Epidemiology. My Master's Thesis examined bone stress injuries in student athletes, and my coursework was particularly focused on global public health and infectious diseases. 

I'm now looking for the perfect opportunity to combine my data science skills with my love of sports and public health data!
