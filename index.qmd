Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Merete!

I'm currently pursuing a Master's of Data Science at the University of British Columbia with an expected completion date of June 30, 2024. Before moving to Vancouver, I played professional volleyball for 5 years in Italy, South Korea, and Japan

In 2018 I graduated from Stanford University with a BS in Human Biology and a MS in Epidemiology. I am passionate about global public health and specifically am fascinated by infectious diseases. 

I'm now looking for the perfect opportunity to combine my data science skills with my love of sports and medical data!
