    "section": "Professional Volleyball",
    "text": "Professional Volleyball\nAfter graduating from Stanford University in 2018 with my MS in Epidemiology and my BS in Human Biology, I followed my dream of playing professional volleyball overseas. Over 5 years I played in three different countries and gained invaluable life experience. I was often the only foreign player on my team, and so I quickly learned how to adapt to and thrive in unfamiliar cultures. I found new ways to communicate and work as part of a team, even in spite of language barriers. Finally, I wholly dedicated myself to perfecting my skill in volleyball, pursuing mastery in my sport. I also won a league championship in South Korea and was named Co-MVP in the championship series! Feel free to check out my instagram @meretelutz for some fun volleyball highlights.\nI‚Äôve always been passionate about sports, and as an athlete I was always interested in the data and metrics my team was collecting. From the court to the office, I now hope to apply my data science skills to the world of sports analytics, ideally combining my love of sports and interest in medical data."
