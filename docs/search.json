    "text": "Professional Volleyball\nAfter graduating from Stanford University in 2018 with my MS in Epidemiology and my BS in Human Biology, I followed my dream of playing professional volleyball overseas. Over 5 years I played in three different countries and gained invaluable life experience. I learned how to adapt to and thrive in unfamiliar cultures, work as part of a team in spite of language barriers, and wholly dedicated myself to perfecting my skills. I also won a league championship in South Korea and was named Co-MVP in the championship series!\nIâ€™ve always been passionate about sports, and as an athlete I was always interested in the data and metrics my team was collecting. From the court to the office, I now hope to apply my data science skills to the world of sports analytics, ideally combining my love of sports and interest in medical data."
